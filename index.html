Also known as "The Redstone Halls", the sublevel 13.13 is and infinitly spanding completely flat smooth bright yellow surface on wich flyes a star from a side to the other, giving it a day-night sicle with same hours as those had in Earth. Everyone who no-clips in here no-clips out of this massive structure conglomeration that is made out of stone variants, like andesite and marble. Durable stone bridges conect numorous cells into wich the complex is devided, with each one of sad cells being dedicated to one of the entity species that can be found in the Backrooms: they are strucrured in ways due to wich any entity that no-clips into this level is lowered to expecific spots, where they eather die due to the structure itself or get extreamely vulnerable and weakened, ready to be slaughtered at tons by a single sword slash. Those cells are perfec for aquarering anything that can be taken from an entity, be it a body part, an essence, an item they use to carry. Some walls in those cells apear to have sopme kind of conection with the level the entity they were ment to grind is from: for instances, the cell dedicated to grind those large centepeds who were humans before eating and apple surve as gateways to <a href="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">level 65</a>, while the one dedicated to farm partygores is a gateway to <a href="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">level =)</a>. They tecnically work as exits to this level, but, for using them like this, one would need to enter the <b>INFESTED</b> cell interiors, in orther to get to the walls and jump into them. For avoiding such a fate, it is recomended to look for an ocasionally apearing tecnological looking door in the bridges that conect each cell, they will take you to a futuristic/tecnological level.

It goes without saying that lots of people try to find this sublevel due to its capacity to offer basically infinite amounts of items for those who are patient enough to wait until it generates them for them. This process rarely takes less than a night, therefore, they use to sleep on the stone bridges and cell outscurfs while waiting for many entitys to die. Eating the entitys generated by those farms and drinking their blood is a comunly used method to prevent the <a href="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wreched cicle</a> from taking place, but it cannot be forgotten you must never do so to infeccius entitys, like the two mentioned in the first paragraph, as doing so might lead to <b>you</b> getting infected, transformed and lured by the farm's atraction.

There is also that beautyfull level exclusive entity that gangs up on those who stay n > 1 nights without sleeping, wich looks like a blue skined avian with lime glowing eyes and is called "Dark Night Predator". Not much is known about them and no cell dedicated to them has ever been found, wich is strange, since there is even a cell dedicated to those shadows that lurke around the last view distance in <a href="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sublevel 18.1</a>, proving there to be no "forbiddeness".

    <li>Waching a redstone tutorial in a naturally generated by the Backrooms coputer triggers teleportation upon video's end</li>
    <li>Building an automatic mechanism in the Backrooms might trigger teleportation</li>
    <li id="map">And last, but <b>definitely not</b> least, finding THIS on any wall and jumping trough leads to no-cliping</li>
